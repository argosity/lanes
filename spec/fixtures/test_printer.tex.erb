Some work from stories others from requirements,
If we are lucky the analysts have thought of resources and environments!!
Does this field accept a digit, a letter or a hash?
What happens if I inject something here a comma or slash?

How about testing stress, load or capacity?
I've found a bug developer please don't be mad at me.
It works on your system? Well it doesn't on mine,
If you take a look and fix it I'm sure production be fine.

Is it secure or can someone break in?
Mess with the system send it in a spin.
Will it failover gracefully and alert you of issues,
Make supporting the system simple and report any misuse.

Can this talk to that and do it in time?
Oh God will the users like it and think its sublime.
Does it do what they want or is it worse than they've got?
After all of this testing I bloody hope not.
