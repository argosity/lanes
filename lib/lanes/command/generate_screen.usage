Create the bare-bones definition of a screen

Screens are a special type of view that have a few extra attributes.
Namely, they have a "title" attribute and can be hidden and shown.  

They are dynamically loaded.  Initially only the definition for the view
is available, and the css and javascript for the view is only loaded
when the view is first displayed.

If the "model-class" option is provided, the screen will only be
available to users who have read or write access to the given model.
